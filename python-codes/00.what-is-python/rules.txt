0. Write READABLE and EASY-TO-MAINTAIN code !!!

1. Use Classes / functions as much as you can.

2. No global variable in a function (always known inputs and outputs)

3. Always use logger

4. Always write tests before writing program.  (unit/integration/scenatio/smoke)
   And normal surce codes / test codes should to DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES

5. Write your tests Data Driven. ( Do not write a test function for all tests, you should write a function derivable using different sets of data  )

6. Use libraries as much as you can. (Do not invent!)
   Open source libraries are tested and corrected better than any other code. Do not write a function on your own if there exists any library for that function.

7. All variables are on top ( Class/function or python file)

8. All imports are on top.

9. Always use long descriptive names for functions/classes/variables. Do not use i,j ....

10. Follow PEP8 standard.

11. Always check your memory usage :
    print(sys.getsizeof(mylist))

12. Use Frameworks :
